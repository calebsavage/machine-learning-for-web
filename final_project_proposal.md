# Final Project Proposal

## See It, Buy It

Commenting on the dystopian aspects of futuristic technologies which are now part of our daily life, I am creating a project which will recognize objects in a video stream and suggest products from an online store which match it.

It will use a smartphone or laptop webcam to capture a video stream, MobileNet to recognize objects, and the Amazon Product Search API to retrieve items. 

While my implementation is intended as a political statement-- it should be creepy-- this type of technology is already in widespread use and will only become more pervasive. The project I'm building could be easily modified for commercial uses-- for example, embedded in another website or app which analyzes a user's video stream (with or without their informed consent) and uses it to serve targeted ads.

The project will have a user interface which is polished enough to look like a real commercial product, but with some satirical aspects which emphasize the privacy concerns it's intended to comment on.
